#To efficiently show bias-variance trade-offs, we need to choose the parameters that are not very complex.
#First, I tried to make dataset generally, without shiny so that it is easier to understand
#For linear model:
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(6.24)
n <- 250
a <- 5
b <- 0.5
epsilon <- 4 #noise level

x <- runif(n, min = 30, max = 60)

# Generate noise (error term)
e1 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)
e2 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)
e3 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)
e4 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)
e5 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)
e6 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)
e7 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)
e8 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)

e10 <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = epsilon)

#True function without noise:
fx = (b*x) + a #in form of y = mx+c 

#function with noise added:
y1 = fx+e1
y2 = fx+e2
y3 = fx+e3
y4 = fx+e4
y5 = fx+e5
y6 = fx+e6
y7 = fx+e7
